    <h1>sp0t Terms of Service</h1>
    <h4><i>Last updated</i>: November 3, 2022</h4>
    <br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms of Service, together with any documents or website links they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these “Terms”), 
        govern your access to or use of the sp0t mobile application (the “Application”), our website, and any other websites, features, content, software, 
        products, events, contests, promotions, and services facilitated through the Application or our website(s), including any improvements, developments, 
        or modifications thereto (collectively, the “Services”) made available by sp0t, an L.L.C. (“sp0t”, “we”, or “us”). Please read these terms carefully, 
        as they constitute a legal agreement between you and sp0t.
        <br>
        <br>
        By accessing or using the Services, you represent and warrant, on behalf of yourself and any person for whom the Services are accessed, 
        that (i) you have read and understood these Terms and (ii) confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, 
        you may not access or use the Services. sp0t may immediately withdraw, discontinue, amend, or terminate your use of any Services or any portion thereof, 
        at any time for any reason, at its sole discretion without notice.
        <br>
        <br>
        Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. 
        sp0t may revise, modify, amend, and update these Terms from time to time in its sole discretion. All changes are effective upon posting and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. 
        Your continued access to or use of the Services after posting of revised terms confirms your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.
        <br>
        <br>
        We may choose to stop offering the Services, or any particular portion of the Services, or modify or replace any aspect of the Services, at any time.  
        We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of our termination of your access to the Services, where in our sole discretion, failure to do so would materially prejudice you. 
        You agree that sp0t will not be liable to you or any third party as a result of our termination of your right to use or otherwise access the Services.
        <br>
        <br>
        You may terminate your access to the Services by deleting your account. So long as you continue to access the Services these Terms are in effect.
    </p>
    <h2>The Application</h2>
    <p>
        The sp0t application enables users to share location-based content with friends and public communities (the “Application”). 
        Unless otherwise agreed by sp0t in a separate written agreement with you, the Services are made available solely for your personal, noncommercial use.
    </p>
    <h2>License to Access and Use of Services</h3>
    <p>
        Subject to your compliance with these Terms, sp0t grants you a limited, non-exclusive, personal, non-commercial, non-sublicensable, revocable, 
        non-transferable license to access and use the Application and the Services for their intended purposes. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by sp0t.
        <br>
        <br>
        You are solely responsible for obtaining Internet or data network access necessary to use the Services and any updates thereto. We do not guarantee that the Services, 
        or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or device or that use of the Services will be uninterrupted or free from delays or malfunctions.
    </p>
    <h2>App store terms</h2>
    <p>
        If you access or download the Application from the Apple App Store (the “App Store”), you will only use the Application (a) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and 
        (b) as permitted by the "Usage Rules" set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and the Services is dependent on the availability of the App Store. 
        You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and sp0t and not with the App Store. sp0t, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Application, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefore, 
        and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) is a third-party beneficiary of these Terms and will have the right to enforce them.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating an account</h2>
    <p>
        To engage in the Services, you must register an active sp0t account (“Account”). In order to create an Account and use the Services: 
        (i) you must be at least 16 years of age 
        (ii) you must have the requisite power and authority to enter into these Terms, 
        (iii) you must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Services under applicable laws, 
        (iv) your Account must not have been previously disabled for violation of law or any of our policies, and (v) you must not be a convicted sex offender.
        <br>
        <br>
        Account registration requires you to submit your phone number. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, 
        and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account log-in information at all times. You may not authorize third parties to use your Account.
        <br>
        <br>
        By creating an Account on the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet all the foregoing eligibility requirements. 
        If you do not meet all the foregoing requirements, you must not create an Account or access or use the Services.
        <br>

                (vii) make available any content that either (x) is violent, threatening, unlawful, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, 
                libelous, or racially, ethnically abusive or otherwise objectionable, (y) is sexual in nature or displays nudity or pornographic material, or

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        sp0t reserves the right to enforce these rules by suspending, adding restrictions to, or banning your account, as well removing any content as the company sees fit. 
        You acknowledge that your use of the Services is at your own risk, including the risk that you might be exposed to content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, objectionable, 
        incomplete, fails to provide adequate warning about potential risks or hazards, or is otherwise inappropriate. Content that users submit or transmit to, through, 
        or in connection with the Services (including any content that may have been created by users employed or contracted by sp0t) does not necessarily reflect the opinion of sp0t.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you fail to comply with any of the foregoing restrictions, you may be denied access to use of the Services.
    </p>

        When you submit content to a public part of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. 
        Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator’s option in the case of private maps) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your sp0t account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about your activities on the Services, 
        such as your name, username, home city, bio, profile picture, avatar, friends, how long you have been a member of the services, and content you have submitted to the Services publicly. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public,
        depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, 
        please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter).
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>We do not sell your personal information.</b> However, in addition to the personal information that is displayed publicly as described above, we may share personal information in the following ways:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                With your consent. We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction.
            </li>
            <li>
                With our service providers. We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us and host our data and services. Their use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
            </li>
            <li>
                To comply with the law. We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, 
                including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request.
            </li>
            <li>
                In an emergency. We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
            </li>
            <li>
                To enforce our policies and rights. We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User Agreement, rules, or other sp0t policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.
            </li>
            <li>
                Aggregated or de-identified information. We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been liked without identifying who the visitors were.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How we protect your information</h2>
    <p>
        We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to nonpublic personal information.
        <br>
        <br>
        We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.
    </p>
    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <p>
        You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services.

        You may submit a request to delete your account by contacting contact@sp0t.app. You can also submit a request to delete the personal information sp0t maintains about you. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.            
        <h3>Controlling Mobile Notifications</h3>
        With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.    
    </p>
    <h2>Your rights</h2> 
    <p>
        <h3>Data subject and consumer information requests</h3>

        <br>
        <br>

        <br>

        Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your sp0t account or to a verified email address associated with your sp0t account. You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. sp0t does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.
    </p>
    <h2>Additional information for California and Nevada users</h2>
    <p>
        The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identifiers, like your sp0t username, email address, IP address, and cookie information.
            </li>
            <li>
                Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as information about your activity on our Services and limited information about your activity on the services of advertisers who use our advertising technology.
            </li>
            <li>
                Geolocation information based on your IP address, or more specific location information if you authorize your device to provide it to us.
            </li>
            <li>
                Audiovisual information in pictures, audio, or video content submitted to sp0t.
            </li>
            <li>
                Professional or employment-related information or demographic information, but only if you explicitly provide it to us, such as by applying for a job or filling out a survey.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inferences we make based on other collected data, for purposes such as recommending content, advertising, and analytics.
            </li>
        </ul>
        You can find more information about (a) what we collect and sources of that information, (b) the business and commercial purposes for collecting that information, and (c) the categories of third parties with whom we share that information in the What We Collect (and How it is Used and Shared) section above.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, including the right to request access to or deletion of your personal information, and information about our data practices, as well as the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights. These rights can be exercised as described in the Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests section above.
